**Gwinnett County Environmental Conservation Organization of Students (G-ECOS)**
is a student-led organization intended to connect students in various Gwinnett County environmental clubs to raise awareness of environmental issues in our community by providing educational resources and hands-on conservation activities. We want to increase participation in environmental action and community service among high school students.
